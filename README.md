# Maze Generation Algorithms
Go implementations of a couple of maze generation algorithms & maze representations.

Just for fun, to learn Go - don't judge.

Implemented:
 - Recursive backtracking
  - Based upon http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking
  - Uses an array of bitfields to represent which walls have been carved
